# Surfs Up

## Overview

### Explanation of Analysis
- In order to better advise W. Avy whether he should open up a surf shop in Oahu, we were tasked to provide more information regarding temperature data for the months of June and December. This would allow him to evaluate whether a year-round business would be sustainable. 
- We created queries to search through our SQLite file for data in the months of June and December. Afterwards, we summarized the statistical analysis of the data in a dataframe.

## Results

### Differences Between June and December
- June had 1,700 recorded temperatures while December had 1,517 recorded temperatures. 
- The average temperature in June was 74.9 degrees Fahrenheight, while the average temperature in December was 71 degrees Fahrenheight. 
- The standard deviation for temperatures recorded in June was 3.26 while the standard deviation in December was 3.76. There is more variability within the temperature in December than in June.
- The coldest recorded temperature in December was 56 degrees, while the coldest day in June was 64. On the other hand, the warmest day in June was 85 and  83 in December.

## Summary

### Results

- Hawaii is known to have a warm climate and the data backs this up. Even in December, the coldest day is 56 degrees. On the other hand, the warmest day was surprisingly low as well, with a high of 85 in June. This is surprising because Hawaii is known to be a tropical, warm state, and the warmest day we have in our recorded temperatures is lower than your average summer day in New York City. This reveals some limitations of our data weather. An important factor in whether people would want to be outdoors is precipitation and humidity. If it rains nearly every day in December, it would be important for us to consider whether it's advisable to open up a surf shop or an ice cream store. We would also want to see more data on weather conditions that would affect waves. For instance, how windy is it on average during these months? Will there be any wind to produce waves for people to surf?
